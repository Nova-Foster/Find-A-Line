-Each grating has a folder with calibration files, these depend on pixel 600 being the 0nm peak from a calibration source and Gadjust being 994775
-The offsets should be set up so the streak camera only has to be moved left to right (the big dial closer to the control pad) so pixel 600 lines up, may be best to base this on grating 1 as it is the most precise
-After moving the grating the pixel seems to change a little, I've tried to make it so it was +-3 at most

To use the files:
1. Click on an opto window and go to the scaling tab
2. Select Multilinear
3. Open the correct file for the grating and center wavelength
